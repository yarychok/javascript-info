// Global object
    // The global object provides variables and functions that are available anywhere.
    // By default, those that are built into the language or the environment.

    // In a browser it is named 'window'.
    // For Node.js it is 'global'.

    // Recently added 'globalThis', as a standardized name for a global object,
    // that should be supported across all environments.

    // Below are the same code
    //     console.log('Hi'); // Hi
    //     globalThis.console.log('Hi'); // Hi
